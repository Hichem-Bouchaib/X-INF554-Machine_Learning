École polytechnique | INF554 - Machine Learning

We have entered the Big Data Era. The explosion and profusion of available data in a wide range of application domains rise up new challenges and opportunities in a plethora of disciplines – ranging from science and engineering to business and society in general. A major challenge is how to take advantage of the unprecedented scale of data, in order to acquire further insights and knowledge for improving the quality of the offered services, and this is where Machine Learning comes in capitalizing on techniques and methodologies from data exploration (statistical profiling, visualization) aiming at identifying patterns, correlations, groupings, modeling and doing predictions. In the last years Deep learning is becoming a very important element for solving large scale prediction problems. 

The Introduction to Machine Learning class will cover the following aspects:

The Machine Learning Pipeline
Unsupervised Learning
Data Preprocessing and Exploration
Feature Selection/Engineering & Dimensionality reduction
Supervised Learning 
Deep and Reinforcement Learning


Logistics
1. The course will take place on Mondays afternoon from 16/09 for 9 weeks and will be divided into nine 4-hour sessions of teaching (14:00 - 16:00) in amphi Gay Lussac and the lab session (16:15 -18:15) will be split between three lab rooms.

2. Due to the high number of enrolled students, labs will not take place in rooms equipped with workstations. Therefore, the students are expected to come in class with their laptops (preferably with a Unix environment like Linux or Mac OS X for compatibility reasons). As for software, we will be using  Python among others (to be installed locally on the laptops). Students are invited to install the Anaconda distribution version 3.7 .
