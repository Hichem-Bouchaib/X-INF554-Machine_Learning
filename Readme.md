We have entered the **Big Data** Era. The explosion and profusion of available data in a wide range of application domains rise up new **challenges** and **opportunities** in a plethora of disciplines – ranging from science and engineering to business and society in general. A major challenge is how to **take advantage** of the unprecedented scale of data, in order to acquire further insights and knowledge for **improving the quality** of the offered services, and this is where **Machine Learning** comes in capitalizing on techniques and methodologies from data exploration (statistical profiling, visualization) aiming at identifying patterns, correlations, groupings, modeling and doing predictions. In the last years **Deep Learning** is becoming a very important element for solving large scale prediction problems. 

The Introduction to Machine Learning class will cover the following aspects:

The Machine Learning Pipeline
Unsupervised Learning
Data Preprocessing and Exploration
Feature Selection/Engineering & Dimensionality reduction
Supervised Learning 
Deep and Reinforcement Learning
